If you use the dataset in your research please use the above citation.

The dataset folder has 171 combinations of groups ( each in a folder). Each group has its individual folder (e.g. gr1_sc1). For each group we have different users in a separate json file. In the file you can find the partial qualitative preferences expressed in connections. The name of a user identifies uniquely a user in all the groups ( when "1" appears in 2 different groups it refers to the same user "1"). The paper gives you details regarding the dataset collection.
